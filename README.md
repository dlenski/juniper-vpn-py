**You don't want this repository. It is retained only for historical purposes.**

As of [OpenConnect v8.09](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/changelog.html),
the `tncc-wrapper.py` and `tncc-emulate.py` scripts are included in the base
OpenConnect distribution. See
[OpenConnect TNCC docs](https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/tncc.html) for
how to use them, and 
[`openconnect/openconnect:trojans/` on GitLab](http://gitlab.com/openconnect/openconnect/tree/master/trojans)
for the repository where further development is proceeding.

All credit goes to their original author,
[@russdill](https://github.com/russdill), for the difficult work of figuring
out how TNCC works and writing these scripts and allowing them to be
included in OpenConnect.
